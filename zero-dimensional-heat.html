  <p>So I have had this thought experiment bothering me for a while. What motivates Batman? What could motivate Batman in the face of an impartial universe? What if he read Sarah Perry’s blog, and agreed with it? Is a nihilist Batman a contradiction? Here is an answer I have come up with.</p>
<hr>
  <h1>Zero-Dimensional Heat</h1>
<p>“I don’t understand. I’ve seen crime, I’ve seen Gotham’s suffering, and I want to help remediate it, but I just don’t see what makes you go to lengths so far. You always go past what the moment necessitates.” Robin says.</p>
<p>Batman, his psychotic mentor, looks at him. The space surrounding his eyes is pitch black, save for two gleaming points near his irises – but probably closer to his scleras – and the movement of shadows suggests the contours of his bat mask.</p>
<p>“Human motivation is built off of a simple principle,” Batman says. “We operate to quell our myriad needs, such as hunger, thirst, libido, curiosity, or aesthetics. Our brain calculates, at any given moment, the best way of doing this. If, over a period of time, we have quelled all our needs to the best of our ability, then we slip into decadence. This isn’t wrong. It’s simply a side-effect of a computational foundation built for a very different world.”</p>
<p>“Okay, so you find that the best way of quelling your own needs is to fight crime. You do this. But crime still exists. You fight it some more. Yet you keep going, and you never falter in your devotion to end it. Why is this? Don’t you get bored? Wouldn’t you, at some point, have understood crime to such a depth that you JOOST into another way of doing it, like social policy reform, rather than beating up street thugs?”</p>
<p>“It’s a little more complicated than that. There is an abstraction below singleton needs. Contradictions in your world model generate heat. Your mind tries to resolve this heat. Some cognitive scientists suggest that this is the basis for consciousness. If you find a point of heat that is so great that it cannot be resolved, then your attention will collapse in on itself. You will be forced to broil in this single point of heat for every waking moment, perhaps even in your dreams. This is the extent of my guilt. This is what enables total devotion to an ideal. Now, what do you imagine happens if you find a behavior that quells those needs that are screaming out in the greatest pain?”</p>
<p>Robin looks away, lost in thought for a moment. Then he looks back at Batman and makes eye contact for exactly 0.8 seconds. He starts to talk and looks away in a conversationally appropriate direction.</p>
<p>“This seems to be trapping you in a local minima of your approach to crime. What would happen if you resolved your own guilt?”</p>
<p>“Redemption is my open-ended moral arc. I am in the limit of total redemption, but I will never reach it. I can only get closer. No epsilon greater than zero will satisfy me. I realized that this is my architecture, the mold I have been cast in, and realized that if I were to break out of the system myself, it would only break me, leaving me formless.”</p>
<p>Using the norms of body language he read in a book when he was eight, Robin scratches his chin.</p>
<p>“You realize this, but you also must realize the meta-problem of crime will never be solved this way. You will hardly make a dent.”</p>
<p>“That’s why I hired you. Leaving Gotham’s redemption in the hands of my own addiction would be dumb. Rather than let my own mental singularity leave me stranded in the local minima you mentioned, I figured I could amplify its power by calculating yet greater ways of reducing crime while also satiating my immediate needs.”</p>
<p>Robin nods in deep understanding. </p>
