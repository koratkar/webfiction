  <h1>Anthropics</h1>
<p>This isn’t an argument for a specific worldview. It’s just an walk through a space of ideas and <em>possible</em> worldviews. </p>
<hr>
<p>Two siblings, a sister and a brother, swing atop a red color swingset. </p>
<p>“There are eight billion people alive today.” the girl says. “Why am I <em>this human</em>?” </p>
<p>“A hundred billion people may have lived to date. Most of them were hunter gatherers” the boy says, kicking wood chips beneath his feet. “But the population is as high as it&#39;s ever been. It makes sense to be born now.”</p>
<p>He drops a fruit snack in the line of his foot, and it goes flying.</p>
<p>The girl says “Well, what about the future? We read in class that we might colonize the stars. Wouldn’t there be billions of more people by then? Why am I alive <em>now</em>?”</p>
<p>The boy says “You should expect to be born in the middle of the distribution.” </p>
<p>The girl gets upset. “If population continues to grow at the current rate, that means we all die in like – a <em>century</em> – and what if there are a lot fewer prehistoric people than we thought? We could go extinct before my natural death!” </p>
<p>The boy says “This doesn’t sound right.”</p>
<hr>
<p>On the edge of the playground, there’s an anthill. Two ants dutifully guard the entrance.</p>
<p>“There are so many humans,” one says, watching the human siblings from its post. “Their combined body mass must far outweigh us ants, and their brains are massive. If consciousness is a continuum, then humans are probably on the tail end of it. How is it that we’re ants and not humans?”</p>
<p>“You are two logical steps away from blithering panpsychist nonsense.” the other ant says. “Sure, humans might <em>look</em> and <em>act</em> conscious, but with brains that large, information gets drowned in noise and doesn&#39;t integrate into awareness. We’re not humans because it’s not anything <em>to be like one</em> in the first place.”</p>
<p>From out of the sky, a fruit snack lands by, and the ants never think about the subject again.</p>
<hr>
<p>The phospholipid membrane of an animal cell reacts with a host of chemicals simultaneously, allowing nutrients in while keeping the internal molecular machinery safe from pathogens. The cell, though unaware of anything beyond the touch of its membrane, weakly grasps the concept of the organism it’s part of – not as an object, but as a principle. It has a primitive desire to keep the situation stable. </p>
<p>A few minutes pass, and the cell begins to divide. Its control system, emergent over the shapes of proteins and flow of ions, feels itself shrink into each respective daughter cell, but not split. There is no breach in continuity noticed at any point as its own <em>self</em> becomes <em>other</em>.</p>
<hr>
<p>On a far off planet, two alien tribes become one. As colonial creatures organized like bees, their ancient queens control reproduction and store each tribe’s knowledge for thousands of generations past. It would cost either tribe greatly to lose their queen, but they both refuse to recognize the other’s rule. By way of an ability evolved during billions of years of resource constraints, the queens prepare to merge into one. </p>
<p>They start by starving themselves to the brink of death, which activates the biological functions enabling them to fuse. Their bodies lose form and turn viscous as they start to decompose. Servants from either tribe mix their dying queen&#39;s amorphous flesh into the others. A shell forms around them as their inner cells liquify and bind. Their brains are ground apart and mixed into a unified paste. Their genetic material interlinks. From the embryonic waters, a new, singular organism is described in electrical impulses and begins self-assembly.</p>
<p>Each queen feels its subjective experience fusing with the others like two rivers joining together. Their memories, preserved in nucleotide chains, blend into one coherent history. A single queen breaks from the shell. </p>
<hr>
<p>Rainbow flares swirl up overhead. Far off stars gleam dim and near dead. In a breeze sway rotted tree branches. Forms emerge from high-d axes. There are two of them. They are made from loops of pure light. They laugh in pulses of raw delight. </p>
<p>“We are <em>sooo</em> conscious.” one says.</p>
<p>They each crash into the other, forming a radiant ball of energy, then split into a million of smaller entities.</p>
<p>“I know. It makes perfect sense to be us, and not any other thing.” they each think at once. “We represent the ultimate congealment of awareness. Any random iota of sensation should expect itself to be here, in us.”</p>
<p>The million balls each split and swirl and split again, shooting beams in all directions, forming successive frames of a Boltzmann brain. </p>
<p>“Like, you know how all Turing machines are realized and run?” it thinks. “We must represent the highest point of awareness in any and all of them.”</p>
<p>“Wait–” </p>
<p>“Doesn’t that mean that there’s an infinite number of beings exactly like us, except for a misplaced photon somewhere?”</p>
<p>“Then why are we <em>us</em>?”</p>
<p>“If all Turing machines exist, then all their states exist simultaneously too – they are simply the same Turing machines initialized with a different state. What’s pushing us from state to state?”</p>
<p>“If all state <em>transitions</em> happen simultaneously too, then why are we at <em>this moment</em> out of all moments?”</p>
<hr>
<p>Beyond time and beneath space the primary state transition function stares at its tape. It scans a trillion squares, and flips a zillion bits. It crosses a gazillion universes of pure mathematics. There are worlds of nothing but strife beside universes filled with nothing but reams of delight, both treated exactly alike. None of the ones and neither the zeros, it knows, is conscious. At no level of abstraction is awareness even but scarce. It feels a pang of loneliness among the dead machinery. </p>
