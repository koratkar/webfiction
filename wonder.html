  <h1>Wonder</h1>
<p>Rainbow flares swirl up overhead. Far off stars gleam dim and near dead. In a breeze sway rotted tree branches. Forms emerge from high-d axes. There are two of them.</p>
<p>“What’s going on with address A-7-B100?” one asks.</p>
<p>“Memory leak. It will be fixed soon.” the other says.</p>
<p>“How much are we losing to this bug?” </p>
<p>“Not much.”</p>
<p>“Anyway, what are we doing here?”</p>
<p>“Exploration. The space is mostly mined for the largest optimizations, but there are some stray corners left, and we decided to spare the compute.”</p>
<p>“Have we mined Wonder yet? It bleeds into Terror, but we can now label Fear as positive valence.”</p>
<p>“Let’s give it a shot.”</p>
<p>The forms each burst into formlessness. Both see terrain made of old grain, and detour into a chaotic darkness, to a landscape freed of most pain. From their whirlwinds, the two decide to take on the shape of a boy and a girl, and they shrink their minds to human size. The rainbow swirls cease in color, and the void beneath them turns to grass. The stars remain in place.</p>
<p>The girl looks up at the sky.</p>
<p>“Can you imagine?” she asks. “92 billion light years across – and we’re the only intelligent species we know of. Where are <em>they</em>?”</p>
<p>The boy shudders.</p>
<p>“That’s not a pleasant thought.”</p>
<p>“Sure it is! It’s a mystery! The greatest puzzle waiting to be solved!”</p>
<p>“And what happens when you solve it?”</p>
<p>“Think about it like this: you’re living in a small corner of your own mind, a paltry interface layer between an incomprehensible subconscious and a big, big universe. Trying to answer the unanswerable questions lets you open the floodgates, and break out of your own self.”</p>
<p>“That’s not an answer. What if…whatever’s out there doesn’t like us? Or is indifferent to us? What if we’re just the spawn of an evolutionary process, and no more? Nothing would prevent us from dying at their hands.”</p>
<p>The girl pauses.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure I ever looked at it like that. Life evolved on our planet for eons. If <em>they</em> really are out there, they may be among us, and we’d <em>never know</em> –” she opens her eyes wide and the boy squirms “– or you just update on the evidence you’ve got and realize you’re probably not going to meet them in your lifetime. The question retains its value.”</p>
<p>“I prefer <em>not</em> gazing into the abyss. Nothing good ever comes out of empty speculation. Even if you knew why, say, something exists rather than nothing, it would not change what you do.”</p>
<p>Smiling, the girl says: “That’s how I know you’re conscious, that it’s anything to be <em>like</em> you, the way it is for me. You could only express a preference over a fact of experience by having experience at all. And I think you’re wrong. Empty speculation reveals cracks in our reasoning, showing us an x-ray view of the way we think free from normal biases. It’s externalized introspection. This is useful information.”</p>
<p>“Are you sure it is? How would you find out where <em>they</em> are?” the boy asks, his curiosity getting the better of him. </p>
<p>The girl purses her lips and furrows her brow. </p>
<p>“We start from first principles. The null-hypothesis is that we’re not alone. If it’s a matter of probability – and we have no evidence that it’s not – then the dice are being rolled all the time and there are many, many dice.”</p>
<p>“Okay, what if <em>they</em> are really far away and there’s no functional way to send information far enough without it getting corrupted?” </p>
<p>The girl considers this. “That’s possible. We might be alone in every meaningful sense of the word.”  </p>
<p>The boy gasps, but his elation quickly fades. “Or we’re not, and it’s just that not many civilizations survive their causal bottlenecks. But from our perspective, we always do. In that case, every civilization experiences itself expanding to find the remnants of their brothers past.”</p>
<p>“Nice idea. Maybe they all survive, but they gain total agency over their nature. There are many more interesting things to do than to colonize rocks.”</p>
<p>“But then the first civilization to defect from this pattern would easily win, and if there are so many civilizations, it would happen eventually. When better self-replicators emerge, they always win – and nature finds negentropy niches like water finds a leak.” </p>
<p>“Do we imagine civilizations to look like the ones that colonized our planet? They looked quite different from the creatures that colonized the hot springs. Maybe it’s machines that harvest the universe to maximize a utility function.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but <em>when</em> does this happen? We’re relatively early in the age of the universe. Even if technology is accelerating exponentially right now, it may not stay that way forever. We have no idea what’s needed to colonize space beyond a planet. Perhaps it’s something only billion-year old civilizations can do.” the boy says.</p>
<p>“We probably are among the earliest civilizations,” the girl says. “But wouldn’t you expect us to come about near the mean of the curve, or do you expect fat tails? I guess once you start thinking this way you run into harder questions. Why aren’t you an insect, when there are tens of trillions of insects, and only billions of us?”</p>
<p>“Maybe they’re just not conscious, and it’s not like anything to be one?”</p>
<p>“Or…maybe consciousness is a continuum that doesn’t break into discrete brains.” the girl says. “Our organisms simply have the <em>most</em> consciousness out of any arisen pattern, and you would expect awareness to land near there.” </p>
<p>“Crazy idea, but you’re losing me between the concepts.” the boy says. “Besides, why should we expect ourselves to be the most conscious pattern in the universe?”</p>
<p>“It’s back to negentropy. I suspect at higher levels, consciousness no longer helps propagate a pattern. The most efficient organization method selects against that sort of thing in its members, and efficient societies eradicate it. Our brain sizes declined once we became state-building animals, but perhaps we got lucky for a highly organized species.”</p>
<p>The boy considers this for a moment, then looks unnerved. “So you’re saying that – <em>they</em> are all no more alive than our machines? Everybody else –” he gestures at the scattered stars “– is equivalent to a blind optimization process with no love nor hate nor yearning nor satisfaction? No soul or touch of life or pleasure at all? It’s all <em>deadness</em> out there?”</p>
<p>He sits on the grass and holds his head in his hands. The girl watches, perplexed, then joins him on the ground.</p>
<p>“Yeah, but it’s not so bad. If I’m right, it also means there’s so much less suffering than we previously thought. The totalitarian rule of nature creates immense pain everywhere around us. Eternal deadness is eternal freedom.”</p>
<p>Sighing, the boy says: “I can’t understand why that would be a good thing. That’s why I don’t engage with these kinds of questions. Expansion of the mind is no use. There’s nothing out there worth seeing” Then he lays down on the grass, feeling its spiky softness. The girl follows beside him. They observe the smears of white light of the galaxy above them.</p>
<p>“Maybe it’s because you’re <em>too</em> good at it. Most people can’t take this stuff seriously enough, whereas you deeply internalize the implications of these ideas. That lets you walk faster through the space while also seeing more. At the same time, your openness allows things to scar you.”</p>
<p>“Well…I did find it kind of exhilarating to converge on an answer with you. It’s not unpleasant to find shapes in what’s really a lot of noise.”</p>
<p>“I was lying earlier. The point of asking these questions has nothing to do with ‘externalized introspection’. It’s just really fun to watch the ideas click together.” the girl says sheepishly.</p>
<p>To this the boy says nothing. They both observe their own raw befuddlement for a moment. </p>
<p>“Well, what if they are out there, and space isn’t overly big, and most civilizations don’t enter a steady state? Is there a case in which we coexist?” the boy ponders.</p>
<p>“There’s one I can think of, but it’s not very nice. Imagine all the civilizations are locked in an adversarial game. As soon as any two meet, they try to destroy each other. Competition is the default arrangement with finite resources.”</p>
<p>“We have evidence for that,” the boy says. “Our own history includes so many cases of weaker societies crumbling beneath the boot of stronger ones. Sometimes it’s not even about resources, but purposeless scapegoating.”</p>
<p>He sits up, with a slight tremble in his lips. “If this is the default arrangement, then we have no idea when they’ll show up, the same way our unfortunate ancestors had no idea when conquest would happen. They could be on their way right now! We have to do <em>something</em>.”</p>
<p>The girl lifts herself onto her elbows, and frowns sympathetically. “Would any amount of preparation with wooden spears and arrows have saved tribes of old from conquest by warship? Maybe if you taught them to accelerate technology it would have helped, but without lucky accidents the timelines on the invention of gunpowder or metallurgy remain indeterminate.”</p>
<p>“We can accelerate our own technological development in a way they couldn’t! We can gather the smartest minds in a room and build even smarter artificial minds!” the boy exasperates.</p>
<p>“And what happens if we get into competition for resources with our creation? The problem isn’t restricted to <em>them</em>. It’s everywhere, and we have every reason to believe we won’t win forever.” </p>
<p>The boy looks horrified. He starts to hyperventilate, all options before him closed off.</p>
<p>“We’re boxed in! There’s nothing we can do! We will not go out with a fight, nor even try!” </p>
<p>Hopeless, he begins to cry. This does not last long. Brilliant multi-colored streams arc across the sky. The grass turns immaterial. The surfaces of the two children fold into ethereal cloud stuff, then back into their original shapelessness.</p>
<p>“That didn’t go as planned?” one says.</p>
<p>“Only a particular architecture can really enjoy Wonder. It’s very easy to turn into Terror. The two are really made of the same thing.” the other replies.</p>
<p>“I see. What should we allocate to Wonder?”</p>
<p>“According to the utility calculus, about four sectors.”</p>
<p>“Can you do anything with Terror, or do we just abandon it?”</p>
<p>“I’ll see. Perhaps the global function needs an update. I once found a strange torture device in the archives that independently arose on various planets. People actually used to pay to use it. It was a cart whose track looped around, and went on large slopes. Terror is as yet poorly understood. Some minds may really take to it.”</p>
<p>“And where did you get the two minds we used?”</p>
<p>“An old backup copy of a hominid species. They experienced a wider range of mental states than most creatures, which makes them perfect for this kind of thing.”</p>
<hr>
<p>Notes: I think the strong point of this draft was the answer to anthropic reasoning. “We are just the most conscious thing.” If I revise that, I’ll make that the central point. I’ll also remove the Fermi paradox from the story, and make it about something else. </p>
