<p>Quick note: In the past, it’s possible White slave owners thought their slaves couldn’t suffer, and mistreated them to fulfill their need for dominance. I’m not sure. I <em>don’t rule out</em> the possibility that insects and microorganisms can suffer, but I think it’s unlikely given the evidence I have. I think it’s personally unpleasant to watch anything in pain, so I don’t go around trying to assert my dominance by dissecting squirrels or whatever, and try to minimize how much suffering I cause via practices like vegetarianism. Call me a narcissist for that – or provide me with evidence that a specific thing can suffer, and I’ll change my mind.</p>
