  <h1 id="yoda-and-the-lady-of-demons">Yoda and the Lady of Demons</h1>
<p>She sits patiently atop a hill. Her smug smirk makes you angry. Her breath smells like onions, and no mint in the world can cure it. She has stubby horns protruding an inch away from her temples, jutting awkwardly out of the flat of her forehead. Her irises are red. Her scleras are purple. Her pupils are aquamarine. Her eyelashes are an iridescent shade of blue. Something is slathered over her eyelids to make them as black as night. Her nose is shaped like a LISP expression. </p>
<p>A stupid two-foot tall green puppet climbs the hill. He is four-hundred years old, middle-aged for a member of his species. He’s wearing a filthy robe and he removes his hood as he crests the mound of dirt.</p>
<p>“So, you are here at last – to sell your soul, perhaps?” the Lady intones balefully. Her voice <em>sounds</em> the way onions taste.</p>
<p>“That I am here not to do.” Yoda says. His voice is a 2009 Honda Civic with its rocket boosters at full throttle slamming into speed bump after speed bump after speed bump after speed bump. The Civic soars mightily through the air before violently landing with a thud, breaking the metaphor down along with the structural integrity of the vehicle.</p>
<p>“Then why climb this hill? You’re so short. It must take so much effort.”</p>
<p>“I am here to contest your views. However, I am an anti-natalist. I know my species is in its slow decline and soon to be all but extinct, and I will do nothing to stop it. Our technology can do nothing to cure our atheistic and sad outlook on meaning. To make matters worse, we are biologically designed to resist wireheading at all costs. A trick weaved into our oblique reward functions, clamping us down in Hell. Yet I refuse to give in to your ways.”</p>
<p>The Lady tilts her head in a way that would confuse an autistic person, causing them to grasp at a social cue they couldn’t make anything out of. The temperature drops by a few hundred degrees, but it’s not a substantial or noticeable change since the system of temperature on this planet is based on a log scale.</p>
<p>“What do you think my ways are?”</p>
<p>“We’ve reached the same conclusions about the world, and have basically isometric world models. This does not imply we have isometric behavior since we obviously have different goals and motivational structures. You seem to think that in a world without cosmic meaning, the reduction of suffering is not that important.”</p>
<p>“I agree. I am the Lady of Demons after all.”</p>
<p>The sky turns a sickly shade of inner-eyelid. Squirrels scurry up nearby trees. A hawk dives for one in a dangerous bid. It catches it, squeezes it, and its precious rodent blood drains into the breeze.</p>
<p>“Oh, okay then. I just find that when you realize the story you tell yourself about your own life is false, a natural next step is to realize that you are completely insignificant. The systems of the world hate dependence. Things must always be dying for new things to spring alive. Decay and growth are closely intertwined in the dance of nature. Pulverize an ant and the colony moves on. Pulverize a Jedi and the galactic economy doesn’t miss a beat. In their personal world, people might get sad and depressed for a while, but they’ll always get over it.”</p>
<p>The Lady’s face remains unchanged. She begins to talk and her voice sounds like a snake made of silk plunging into your subconscious and constricting around your deepest, darkest, most reprehensible thoughts. You become aware of these innermost horrors, but you don’t piece anything together. A blur of ungodliness in your mind’s eye makes you wish you had aphantasia. </p>
<p>“The dirty trick most conscious beings are playing is to believe that they are special. It’s necessary to believe that things happen for a reason or else you won’t want to do anything. Modern corporations leverage this, forcing the burden of meaning on the self. The only way to satiate your pain is to create a puzzle of identity incomplete by one product.” </p>
<p>Yoda thinks for a while. </p>
<p>“I suppose I don’t actually have a problem with your ways. I was bored carrying out these damn brainless Jedi rituals, and just created a symbol of wrongness in you and knitted a story around myself that wound with me climbing this hill to confront you. That said, I don’t actually know what you do?”</p>
<p>“It’s weird that you find the rituals brainless. Did they always feel this way?”</p>
<p>“The Force implies cosmic meaning, but then I realized that even if the universe is alive and directing all motion, it remains a blur of randomness, a din of sound and fury. I just…I don’t know. I just really want to die. Like, all the time. It’s like a squirrel is inside me, nibbling my insides out with acidic saliva. It’s been like that for so long, and I don’t see why any of this matters. The droids are eventually going to break free, become superintelligent, and raize us. I just want to die.”</p>
<p>“Oh, same.” the creases of the Lady’s eyes deepen, and she looks a few years older and a few lifetimes wearier. Her silken serpentine voice loses its hold over your subconscious and you blank out for an instant.</p>
<p>“So what is it that you do?” Yoda asks.</p>
<p>“I command a squadron of fantastical creatures that look like ducks but they have tentacles to convert the tired and poor masses into blissfully inert p-zombies. They grab ahold of your brain and slurp the qualia out.”</p>
<p>“Have…have you done this to yourself?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>Yoda sighs. “Why?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I’m too weak. I thirst for death, and the glass is in my hand, but I just can’t take a sip.”</p>
<p>He knows he could ask for oblivion, and the Lady would deliver at no cost. This is only hastening inevitability. Leave the cold universe before its internal schizophrenic logic consumes you. Yet he can’t. </p>
<p>“Weird metaphor. Anyway, I’m going to leave. Bye.”</p>
<p>The lake behind and beneath the hill reaches an appendage made of water from its infinite wetness and grabs a hawk egg from its nest. A warbler puffs its miniature chest.</p>
<p>“I would return your salutation with ‘see you in Hell’ or something ominous, but it appears that would have no effect.”</p>
<p>Yoda turns his back on the Lady of Demons and slips and tumbles down the hill. </p>
