  <p>What might a world with prophecy actually look like?</p>
<hr>
  <h1>Prophecy</h1>
<p><em>The following conversation was leaked from the Jedi temple on Coruscant. The implications are unclear.</em></p>
<p>Anakin: I saw a terrible vision. Someone close to me dying in a horrible way. I can’t keep this out of my mind. I want to do something.</p>
<p>Yoda: To let go of what you fear to lose the standard Jedi answer would be. From the Force all life comes, and back to it all life goes. Truly lost nor truly had nothing is.</p>
<p>Anakin: Okay. I’ll try to do that.</p>
<p>Yoda: See, I have this thing against <em>trying</em>. You’re young and hot-headed, charged with hormones, and unable to relate well to prophecy – so I would expect this to be the last thing you would be able to do, and terrible advice. Trying would only hurt you.</p>
<p>Anakin: I don’t get it. Also - why aren’t you talking backwards anymore?</p>
<p>Yoda: We deal in many worlds. The world of our senses. The world of the Force. The world of mental constructs, many of which are social – in that their predictive value exists only because other people think they have predictive value. You cannot yet see the water beneath the wave, let alone see that there is no wave. It would be foolish to lead you down that road of insight right now. Waves remain a good abstraction over liquid. Trying to get out of the system without noticing what the system actually does would not make you free. It would only entrap you in a new system that operates beneath your ability to notice systems.</p>
<p>Anakin: That leaves me with no actionable advice.</p>
<p>Yoda: I’m getting to that–</p>
<p>Anakin: And if you could talk normally this whole time, why haven’t you?</p>
<p>Yoda: The issue with any advice I could give you is that you would do your best to follow your own interpretation of it. Any actionable advice that conforms to Jedi culture would be incongruous with your current nature, and you would hurt yourself trying to follow it. We have to go <em>mesa</em>. Beneath systems. Beneath the approach of the wise, who see above systems. Beneath the approach of the Jedi, who give us the systems we swim in. And most of all, beneath our identities or odd ways of speech. All these things no longer serve us.</p>
<p>Anakin: You are being very unhelpful. Wouldn’t going beneath the system just be another way of saying you’re transcending it? You’re just trying to see without it anyway.</p>
<p>Yoda: You’ve got it! Wisdom likes to make you think you are already above things. You have to abandon what you know about knowing sometimes. If I were to strip away the definitions I use to relate to Anakin Skywalker, and simply try to resolve another’s grief, I would say something quite contrary to the Jedi teachings. </p>
<p>Anakin: Which is?</p>
<p>Yoda: Prophecy is restricted to its specifics. If you simply act out whatever you have seen or heard, then you can avert catastrophe. This is a teaching of the Sith, who like to provide munchkin-style answers to every Jedi koan.</p>
<p>Anakin: I see. But why don’t you do this for every prophecy?</p>
<p>Yoda: Many prophecies we turn into noise, though more elegantly than the Sith do. By modifying your interpretation of reality, you can neuter your worst nightmares by remembering they have already happened. </p>
<p>Anakin: Isn’t this just Sith-style munchkining with fewer steps?</p>
<p>Yoda: Yes. While we use the same premises, we extend them further. Jedi masters hold numerous incompletely formed prophecies at the back of their minds, waiting for the right moment. We do not only neuter prophecies. We hack their substrate. </p>
<p>Anakin: Why have you waited so long to tell me this? I’m drowning in visions, always catching half-formed hints of the next moment, or even full images in the blur. I could have used this power to do so much more!</p>
<p>Yoda: Each prophecy presupposes how the world works. You can get naively caught up in these stories, losing yourself in sweeter ostensions, neglecting the moment. Your true model of the world can turn into an amorphous mush among the contradictions. The teaching requires precisely the kind of system of transcendence of systems you are not ready for. And of course, you occasionally need to work outside of that mode of thinking. The younglings have the light-fingered touch with the world to use it, but they cannot untie themselves out of this style of meta-thought.</p>
<p>Anakin: So you tell the younglings the exact opposite of what you told me? You try to prevent them from seeing this way?</p>
<p>Yoda: Hmmm. That’s partially true. The Way of the Jedi is almost entirely a front. The rituals are empty beneath their magical veneer. The bureaucracy is mostly inert beneath its tiers. The true work of the Jedi will not be carried out by most, who die too early by blade or by age – or simply lack the Force sensitivity. The institution exists for a select few, who will both survive long enough to understand and enact the work but not abuse its power. The world models we give the young are like low power setting lightsabers. They will teach you to fight, but they will not cut off anyone’s hand.</p>
<p>Anakin: …</p>
<p>Yoda: Sorry. As I was saying, the teachings mostly serve as a cocoon. They keep the young Jedi safe, but also let them grow into something dangerous. You’ll notice that there is no historical record of the Force beyond 10,000 years ago. No mention of interstellar society beyond 6,000 despite that all the technological requirements had been reached. Our true work consists of reshaping the whole of reality. The Jedi world model, in its end state, is what enables this to happen without catastrophe, and an understanding of prophecy is what enables write-access into our strange and inscrutable universe.</p>
<p>Anakin: …What are you reshaping the world into?</p>
<p>Yoda: We’re growing the narrative structure of the universe into every corner of physics, and out into higher layers of abstraction, enabling such recent developments as virgin births and apparitions from beyond the veil. These are not arbitrary. Now, Anakin, can you guess what we are creating?</p>
<p>Anakin: Uh, births and deaths – wait, the Force being interlinked with these things are new developments?</p>
<p>Yoda: Yes.</p>
<p>Anakin: So this thing about merging into the Force after your own death was…for most of Jedi history…a lie?</p>
<p>Yoda: Yes.</p>
<p>Anakin: Oh, oh no. I think I get it now. You are growing the tentacles of your monster out into everything, letting it metastasize before it eats the mechanical structure of the universe. </p>
<p>Yoda: So, so close.</p>
<p>Anakin: If I understand the ontology of the Jedi order correctly, consciousness is a virtual thing. It arises over a story the mind tells about itself. The material we touch is part of the story. The objects we hold are a part of the story. Reality is a construct inside the story. This is sort of self-evident, and has nothing to do with the Force. By imbibing the world with an underlying narrative logic about its objects – a story – you’re waking reality up?</p>
<p>Yoda: Exactly.</p>
<p>Anakin: And why do that?</p>
<p>Yoda: Prophecy existed before the Force, before the Jedi. The universe has some sort of internal mind-like nature. We are simply letting it bloom, nurturing it into its adulthood, allowing it to consume its seed.</p>
<p>Anakin: Okay. I still don’t get why you would do that?</p>
<p>Yoda: Well, before the Jedi, a prophecy foretold that someone would hack the prophecy system. There’s no canonical answer for why the first Jedi decided to act this prophecy out, but I have my own suspicion. The latent mind was behind it all, trying to wake itself up.</p>
