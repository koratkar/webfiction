  <h1 id="yoda-s-startup-gets-acquired">Yoda&#39;s startup gets acquired</h1>
<p>The Table sits in the middle of the main conference room of Big Corp Inc. It’s mahogany, or something. It’s certainly expensive. The Table is square, with rounded edges to make it look modern. This makes it uncomfortable to sit, and hard to grok who’s talking to who. But since most of the Millenium Startup Inc. crew are wearing ostentatious name stickers (“Hello, My Name is”) on their lime-green logo-ed shirts, it works out okay. Only the two foot tall founder of Millenium Startup Inc. wears a worn out dish rag as a cowl. He looks like a toddler chaplain, and he talks like an idiot. He stands on top of his Herman-Miller chair, occasionally pushing off the table to spin around. </p>
<p>“We’re offering ten million for Millenium Startup Inc.” rasps a bear-looking guy sitting on the rounded curve of the Table. This is the CEO of Big Corp. He’s wearing a Steve Jobs black turtleneck, and he’s acting a little distant, a little jittery. This really isn’t worth much of his time. “Are you interested in this deal?”  </p>
<p>“Hmmmm,” Yoda says. His larynx shakes like a torpedo boat engine being started. “A deal that sounds like.”  </p>
<p>The scrawny blond hacker kid next to Yoda buries his face in his hands. He’s read all about this in countless business books. <em>You’re supposed to do a foot-ball huddle in the corner of the conference room to whisper random things before you accept ANY deal! You must make them think that you’re thinking!</em>  </p>
<p>To the left of Yoda sits Leia. Her relationship with Luke has been very complicated since Millenium Startup’s fifth business plan revision. She understands that they must do the company huddle before bear-guy catches wind that they totally accept the offer. In every acquisition, there is always one sucker. In the first, and most common type of acquisition, it is usually the company being acquired. In the second, very rare type of acquisition, it is the big fish.  </p>
<p>The big fish is willing to play sycophant on what they deem to be valuable. There persists a breed of company that is so dead set on a vision of the future that mammoth corporations will pay almost anything to grab hold of their enigmas. </p>
<p>This is, without any doubt, the first type of startup. Leia knows this. She thinks Yoda’s right – take the money and leave, but they can’t <em>look</em> like the sucker right now. You must try as hard as you can not to be that sucker, and if you cannot avoid it, you must avoid <em>looking</em> like the sucker. </p>
<p>On the other side of Leia sits Han. Luke has been shooting him surreptitious glances to get him to make sure he does not say anything. Because Leia thinks highly of Luke, Han is forced to comply. Luke doesn’t want Han to squawk because he knows that Han is dead set on raising the price. He knows better than anyone else that this company is to the future what a polyethylene shopping bag filled with air is to scuba diving gear. </p>
<p>Next to Bear-Guy sits Personality-Less Woman. Her face has not so much as twitched throughout this meeting. What’s her deal?</p>
<p>Luke’s face emerges from the palms of his hands. Bear-Guy is still staring at him. </p>
<p>“Um, can we call a team meeting about it first?” says Luke with immense pressure in his voice.</p>
<p>Bear-Guy silently nods. Han is somehow still under the impression that this guy can still be fooled into thinking this is a Type II company. What he doesn’t realize is that money does not have any value to Bear-Guy. Big Corp does not care for Millenium Startup’s product. He only cares for the team. This is an acquihire. Inside the team, Luke, Leia, and Han are of no value to Big Corp. It is only Yoda, the strategic mastermind that he is, who is of any worth to Big Corp. </p>
<p>Bear-Guy is very rarely intimidated by anything. But this Yoda fellow. . . he has <em>balls</em>.</p>
<p>In the corner of the conference room, a team huddle is going on. Luke, Leia, and Han stand on their knees, and Yoda’s three-fingered hands dig into Han and Leia’s shoulders. He faces Luke directly.</p>
<p>“Well,” Luke whispers. “Are we taking it?”</p>
<p>“No,” Han whispers, loudly enough for Bear Guy to hear. “Double it and <em>maybe</em> we can talk.”</p>
<p>“Um, ten million is a lot already.” says Leia.</p>
<p>“Are you kidding?” says Han, making Luke grimace.</p>
<p>“Would it be a bad time for me to say ‘don’t get cocky, Han?’” says Luke.</p>
<p>Luke shoots a look at Personality-Less Woman. She’s scribbling something in a memo pad. She scratches a loud slash across the paper with her pen, tosses the memo pad on the desk, takes in a long draw of air, and gets up to leave. </p>
<p>Oh no. </p>
<p>Not all is lost – yet. From under the table, Bear-Guy’s legs are still visible. He is tapping out a complicated rhythm with his sneakered feet into the dense carpet. </p>
<p>“Yes,” revs Yoda’s boat-engine vocal cords, so that everyone in the room can clearly hear. “The deal we take. We huddled like this why are? Under the impression that Big Corp is overpaying no one is. A better deal elsewhere it’ll only be because of inflation if we find!”</p>
<p>“You’re supposed to whisper,” gushes Leia. </p>
<p>“Obviously bugged this place is.” says Yoda. “Made up their mind they have, let’s go!”</p>
<p>Luke pats everyone’s back with an air of finality. He pops his head up and looks at Bear-Guy, who is pretending to check email on his phone, while really observing the happening out of the corner of his eye with more fascination than he has put into any meeting ever. <em>Jesus, this Yoda is something!</em></p>
<p>“We’ll take it!” says Luke.</p>
<p>Bear-Guy nods. He’s found his successor.</p>
